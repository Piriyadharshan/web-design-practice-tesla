# web-design-practice-tesla

This project is a three-page front-end website developed as part of my academic learning experience.  
It focuses on recreating a modern, high-quality user interface to understand how structured layouts,
styling, and client-side interactivity work together in real-world web design.

## Objectives
- Practice semantic HTML structure
- Apply CSS for layout, responsiveness, and visual consistency
- Implement JavaScript for basic interactivity and dynamic behaviour
- Understand how multi-page navigation is organised in a front-end project

## Pages Included
- Landing Page
- Product Information Page
- Contact / Interaction Page

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, positioning, responsive design)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and event handling)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I developed a stronger understanding of:
- Translating design concepts into functional web pages
- Managing file structure and relative linking between pages
- Building responsive layouts without back-end integration
- Writing clean, maintainable front-end code

## Note
This project was created solely for educational purposes to practice front-end development skills.
